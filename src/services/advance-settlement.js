/**
 * Bring a settlement up to date: load, simulate, write back.
 *
 * This is what every page load calls before rendering anything. It takes a `client`
 * and assumes the caller has opened a transaction, because the read-modify-write is
 * only safe as a unit.
 *
 * The row lock matters more than it looks. Two requests arriving together — a page
 * load and a build order, say — would otherwise both read the same `last_tick_at`,
 * both compute the same elapsed hours, and both add that production. Resources would
 * quietly double. `for update` makes the second request wait for the first to commit,
 * after which it sees an already-advanced clock and computes nothing.
 *
 * @returns {{ state: object, events: object[] }} events are the log to show on login
